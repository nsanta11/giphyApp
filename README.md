# giphyApp
App to display various giphys related to places

This project is an app that displays giffs related to countries or cities that you can search for in the input box.

It is useful to for displaying fun and intertive giffs to your liking. 

Users can search for any place they like, or can click upon already existing places.

When the user clicks on a button, the page displays 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it goes back to still.

Users can help by contributing and commenting on how else to improve the fucntionality of app and code.

I am the sole maintainer of this app.
